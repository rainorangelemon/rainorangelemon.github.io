Some personal facts of mine are included here:

## Motto

*The secret of happiness is freedom, and the secret of freedom is courage.*

## Hobbies

In my free time, I like to:
	
- Learn new languages (both natural and programming)
	
- Write [blogs](https://blog.fishlemon.com)

- Running (5km average)

- Read books and movies

	- My favourite book is [*Principles*](https://www.principles.com/).

	- My favourite English movie is [*The Shawshank Redemption*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111161/).

- I like failure more than success, because success only gives me the feeling that I am right, while failure teaches me lessons. So I'd like to try to make errors when learning.

## Future Plan

- To be honest, I am still considering whether to go to company or stay in school, after I finish my study.

- Some friends of mine are quite straight. They want to make big money, so they go for a master degree, and search for jobs in [FLAG](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=FLAG%20Companies).

- Some friends do not know what to do. They just follow big issues talked by the media.

- Some friends have their dreams. But they are afraid of breaking their dreams once they meet problems. As a result, they are doing some irrelevant things, while keeping dreaming the dreams.

- I think the main reason for failure is that one has not persisted with only one goal for long. All I can do is keep following my instinct and do the best.

- As a result, I need some time to think about what my instinct is, which a prusuit for Ph.D can offer.
